# Pon tutorial

Pon is a programming language that tries to be very beginner-friendly while also being powerful enough to allow to write complex programs with ease.

So, let's begin learning!

## Program structure

Programs in Pon consist of lines and are executed line-by-line. For example, consider this program:

```pon
let (the console input from the user) be {the user's name}
display (formatted {Hello, (the user's name)!})
```

The program above is quite complicated for a first Pon program to be shown to a beginner, but it allows to show many Pon concepts. Let's go through this program and understand what it does.

The first thing that we encounter here - `let {} be {}` - is an *action*.

### Actions

Actions are the core component of Pon. They are basically just named lists of instructions to the computer. Whenever you invoke an action, its contents get executed.

There are two types of 

Let's start with a simpler action - `display {}` - and then we'll get to `let {} be {}`.

`display {}` is a *regular action*.

#### Regular actions

A regular action is an action that just does something and (optionally) returns the result.

To call an action - any action - you'd need to write its name. However, some actions have gaps in their names. In order to call such actions, we'd need to *fill the gaps*.
