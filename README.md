Pon is a minimalistic programming language that is intended for very high-level programs.

## Goals of Pon

* Be readable: everyone should be able to read Pon code, even if they know nothing about the language
* Be simple: everyone should be able to write Pon code after a short introduction, even if they had no prior knowledge of Pon. Pon should not intimidate the user with new terms and complicated concepts. Instead, Pon should use things that the user is likely to know already
