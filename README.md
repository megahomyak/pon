# pon

*The first rebellious programming language, whatever that means.*

## Project status

Currently, the project is in its alpha stages. I have a vision for it an a complete set of behaviors the language will going to have in the future, but for now Pon is not exactly what I want it to be. Do not judge this language's ideas just yet; they are not what's currently implemented. The current implementation is not a subset, but a fork of the original idea, including many changes and things that will be done differently in the final version.

## Goals of Pon

* Be powerful
* Be simple
* Be pragmatic
